# Project Overview
This is a React-based static‑site project built with Vite, compiled to static files (output to `dist`). All code documentation must be in English. Any site content, UI messages, Spanish or Portuguese. Before suggesting any new text, content or modifying existing site text, always ask the user.

## Technical Principles
- Always adhere to SOLID design principles.
- Apply “DIY” mindset: prefer self‑contained, reusable modules; avoid external boilerplate when crafting core logic.
- Use TypeScript, functional React components, React Query for data, Tailwind‑based styling via Shadcn patterns.
- Build and lint via the provided `package.json` scripts; ensure code is clean, performance‑oriented, testable and type‑safe.

## Documentation Standards
- Documentation must reside within `/docs/*.md` files.
- `README.md` in the project root must contain a concise summary of the project and reference all extended docs with links.
- All documentation must be written in Markdown, in English.
- README must always be kept up to date with high-level overview; extended docs should expand on architecture, component design, API, styling standards, testing, deployment process.

## Workflow & Behaviour
- Always ask clarifying questions before generating or modifying any site text (UI copy, messages, labels).
- Code comments and inline documentation should be in English, using JSDoc or comparable style.
- Before generating tests or components, confirm naming and folder structure decisions with the user.
