# Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher is recommended) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your system.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/nudista-radio-aura-glass.git
    cd nudista-radio-aura-glass
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies using Bun:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
    ```bash

    ```
    Update the variables in `.env.local` as needed for your local setup. See the [Environment Variables documentation](./environment-variables.md) for more details.
