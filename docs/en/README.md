### Key Concepts

- **Multilingual & Dynamic Content**: Content is managed as Markdown per language, auto-indexed and available in navigation and routes. Add new languages/content with minimal effort.
- **Custom Vite Plugins**: Multi-language build and content indexing are handled automatically at build time.
- **Debug & Extensibility**: Debug bar and context providers help with development and troubleshooting. The system is designed for easy extension.
